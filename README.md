# Analysis of a business request to identify the best market segments for a client
# I. Context
After successfully completing several projects across diverse industries—including insurance, retail, pharmaceuticals, and real estate—our consulting firm, Data ESN, has finally secured a long-awaited mission in our target sector: the video game industry.

Following a successful assignment with Les plus beaux logis de Paris, Jade, the account manager, has reached out with a new opportunity. I’ve now joined the UOI Games team to collaborate on an exciting project: the development of their first Triple A video game.

Juliette, the project lead, has tasked me with delivering a data-driven market study to help guide the direction of their new title. The stakes are high—developing a Triple A game requires significant investment and coordination across multiple departments, from developers and designers to marketers and external partners like influencers or streaming platforms.

Rather than focusing on development cost modeling, the mission is to identify market trends, player preferences, and strategic opportunities that can shape the game’s concept and ecosystem. My recommendations will help define:

Which consumer segment(s) to target,

What game genre or platform could perform best,

And whether there’s room for a unique IP or a revival of an existing model.

To support this, I will perform data analyses, survey players, and provide fact-based insights through visualizations and reports.

# II. Methodology
## 1. Data Collection
Reviewed the three provided datasets:

All_publish_VideoGame_2022.xlsb: Game listings with player scores and metadata.

VideoGame_Sales_1980-2016.xlsx: Historical sales data across titles.

Vente de console_2022.xlsx: Console sales by brand and year.

Collected additional data from public sources (Statista, Newzoo, SteamCharts, Reddit trends) to identify emerging market trends and gamer behaviors.

Built a Google Form with at least five key questions to test hypotheses about consumer preferences, platform usage, and genre trends. A minimum of 10 responses was gathered.

## 2. Market & Consumer Analysis
Conducted a PESTEL analysis to examine macro-environmental influences (Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Environmental, Legal).

Built a SWOT matrix (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) to position UOI Games within the competitive landscape.

Segmented consumers based on:

Age group (e.g., 13–17, 18–34, 35–50),

Gender,

Preferred platform (console, PC, mobile),

Game genre (FPS, RPG, strategy, indie, etc.).

Analyzed sales and rating data to understand the relationship between review scores, genre, platform, and commercial success.

## 3. Survey Deployment
Designed and distributed an online questionnaire with questions such as:

What genres do you play most often?

How many hours per week do you game?

What platform do you use most?

Do you prefer online multiplayer or solo campaigns?

Would you try a new IP or prefer known franchises?

Analyzed the results in Excel and checked for correlations between variables like genre and platform preference, or age and game type.

## 4. Insight Generation & Recommendation
Identified statistical trends in the sales and review data.

Cross-analyzed consumer survey responses with market data.

Selected one or more high-potential market segments.

Used visual dashboards (via Tableau or Power BI) to present insights.

Drafted strategic recommendations, including:

A suggested game genre and setting (e.g., sci-fi survival FPS),

Preferred platforms (e.g., next-gen consoles, PC),

Ecosystem opportunities (e.g., Twitch campaigns, web series, NFTs, merchandising).

## 5. Presentation & Documentation
Followed the company’s official PowerPoint template.

Documented sources and cited all external data.

Structured the final presentation into:

Executive summary,

Market analysis (SWOT + PESTEL),

Consumer segmentation,

Survey insights,

Game recommendation,

Ecosystem concept,

Sales potential forecast.
