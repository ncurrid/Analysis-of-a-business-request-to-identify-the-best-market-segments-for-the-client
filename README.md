# Creation of my professionnal data analysis portfolio
# I. Context
As part of my training as a Data Analyst, I was presented with an opportunity to apply for a mission within an international team, working for a leading aeronautics manufacturer. This mission, set to begin in two weeks and lasting four months, will involve optimising the supply chain processes between the client and its European suppliers. It includes multiple business trips across Europe and close collaboration with logistics teams.

The goal of this mission is to improve the efficiency of supply chain operations through data analysis and the development of interactive dashboards that will support decision-making for logistics managers.

To apply for this position, I must demonstrate my skills through a custom-made dashboard and a professional portfolio. This assignment will showcase the technical and analytical competencies I have acquired during my training, as well as my ability to apply them in real-world business contexts.

# II. Methodology
## 1. Data Collection and Cleaning
Downloaded the "Référentiel de Compétences" dataset, which lists all the certifiable skills from my training program.

Cleaned the dataset by removing irrelevant entries and selecting key skills to highlight in the dashboard.

Reviewed completed training projects to recall the tools, methods, and skills used.

## 2. Skills Assessment
Identified the hard skills (e.g., data visualization, data manipulation, SQL) and soft skills (e.g., communication, teamwork, problem-solving) most relevant to the upcoming mission.

Requested feedback from my mentor to assess my skill level before and after completing each major project.

Performed a self-evaluation using a competency scale and training tools, such as skill grids and reflection logs.

## 3. Dashboard Design
Created a mind map in Miro to define the dashboard structure and color palette.

Analyzed examples on Tableau Public to explore effective design patterns and types of visualizations.

Designed a mock-up in Figma, mapping each skill to a specific type of visualization (bar charts, radar charts, timelines, etc.).

Documented each step and rationale to ensure consistency and traceability.

## 4. Data Structuring
Created structured tables in Excel to consolidate skill levels, project references, tools used, and training milestones.

Defined keys (e.g., project ID, skill category) to link datasets via relationships in Tableau.

Built a data dictionary to describe variables and ensure data consistency.

## 5. Interactive Dashboard Creation
Imported and connected the datasets in Tableau.

Developed multiple visualizations to illustrate skill acquisition and progression over time.

Used calculated fields and parameters to enhance interactivity and personalization of the dashboard.

Added filters and actions to allow users to explore different skill areas and project contributions.

Created a main dashboard view that links to my portfolio for deeper insight into each project.

## 6. Portfolio Development
Built a professional portfolio in a collaborative platform (e.g., Notion, GitHub Pages).

Created a dedicated section for each completed project, including:

Project context and objectives

Tools and methods used

Key deliverables

Skills applied and developed

Links to code or dashboards when applicable

Included a section on certifications and technical training.

Embedded a link to the interactive dashboard.
