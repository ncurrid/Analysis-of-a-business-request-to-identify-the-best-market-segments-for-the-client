# Analysis of a business request to identify the best market segments for a client
# I. Context
After successfully completing several projects across diverse industries, including insurance, retail, pharmaceuticals, and real estate, our consulting firm, ESN Data, secured a mission in our target sector: the video game industry.

Following a successful assignment with 'Les plus beaux logis de Paris', the account manager, reached out to me with the opportunity to join the UOI Games team to collaborate on the development of their first Triple A video game.

The project lead tasked me with delivering a data-driven market study to help guide the direction of their new title. The stakes are high as developing a Triple A game requires significant investment and coordination across multiple departments, from developers and designers to marketers and external partners like influencers or streaming platforms.

Rather than focusing on development cost modeling, the mission was to identify market trends, player preferences, and strategic opportunities that could shape the gameâ€™s concept and ecosystem. My recommendations should help define:

- Which consumer segment(s) to target

- What game genre or platform could perform best

To support this, I performed data analyses, survey players, and provided fact-based insights through visualisations and reports.

# II. Methodology
## 1. Data Collection
Reviewed the three provided datasets:

- All_publish_VideoGame_2022.xlsb: Game listings with player scores and metadata.

- VideoGame_Sales_1980-2016.xlsx: Historical sales data across titles.

- Vente de console_2022.xlsx: Console sales by brand and year.

Collected additional data from public sources (rawg.io, etc.) to identify emerging market trends and gamer behaviors.

Built a Google Form to test hypotheses about consumer preferences, platform usage, and genre trends.

## 2. Market & consumer analysis
Conducted a PESTEL analysis to examine macro-environmental influences (Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Environmental, Legal).

Built a SWOT matrix (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) to position UOI Games within the competitive landscape.

Segmented consumers based on: age group, gender, preferred platform, game genre.

Analysed sales data to understand the relationship between genre, platform, and commercial success.

## 3. Survey deployment
Designed and distributed an online questionnaire with questions such as:

- What genres do you play most often?
- What platform do you use most?
- Do you prefer online multiplayer or solo campaigns?
- Have you ever bought additionnal content in a game?
- What is your motivation in carrying on playing on a online game?
- Have you ever played a game in streaming?
- Would you prefer bying a game to download or a physical one?

Analysed the results in Excel and checked for correlations between variables like genre and platform preference, or age and game type.

## 4. Insight generation & recommendation
Identified statistical trends in the sales and review data.

Cross-analysed consumer survey responses with market data.

Selected a high-potential market segment.

Used Power BI to present insights.

Drafted strategic recommendations, including:

- A suggested game genre and setting
- Preferred platforms
- Ecosystem opportunities
- Sales potential forecast
